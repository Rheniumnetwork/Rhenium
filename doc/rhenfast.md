##SwiftX Technical Information

SwiftX has been integrated into the Core Daemon in two ways:
=======
##RhenFAST Technical Information

RhenFAST has been integrated into the Core Daemon in two ways:
>>>>>>> 3cb3aa92098e45afdbb5a3121b74b2ebf7e1705e
* "push" notifications (ZMQ and `-rhenfastnotify` cmd-line/config option);
* RPC commands.

####ZMQ

When a "Transaction Lock" occurs the hash of the related transaction is broadcasted through ZMQ using both the `zmqpubrawtxlock` and `zmqpubhashtxlock` channels.

<<<<<<< HEAD
* `zmqpubrawtxlock`: publishes the raw transaction when locked via SwiftX
* `zmqpubhashtxlock`: publishes the transaction hash when locked via SwiftX

This mechanism has been integrated into Bitcore-Node-Rhenium which allows for notification to be broadcast through Insight API in one of two ways:
* WebSocket: 
* API:  

####Command line option

When a wallet SwiftX transaction is successfully locked a shell command provided in this option is executed (`%s` in `<cmd>` is replaced by TxID):

* `zmqpubrawtxlock`: publishes the raw transaction when locked via RhenFAST
* `zmqpubhashtxlock`: publishes the transaction hash when locked via RhenFAST

This mechanism has been integrated into Bitcore-Node-Rhenium which allows for notification to be broadcast through Insight API in one of two ways:
* WebSocket: [https://github.com/Rhenium-Project/insight-api-Rhenium#web-socket-api](https://github.com/Rhenium-Project/insight-api-Rhenium#web-socket-api) 
* API: [https://github.com/Rhenium-Project/insight-api-Rhenium#rhenfast-transactions](https://github.com/Rhenium-Project/insight-api-Rhenium#rhenfast-transactions) 

####Command line option

When a wallet RhenFAST transaction is successfully locked a shell command provided in this option is executed (`%s` in `<cmd>` is replaced by TxID):
>>>>>>> 3cb3aa92098e45afdbb5a3121b74b2ebf7e1705e

```
-rhenfastnotify=<cmd>
```

####RPC

Details pertaining to an observed "Transaction Lock" can also be retrieved through RPC, itâ€™s important however to understand the underlying mechanism.

By default, the Rhenium Core daemon will launch using the following constant:

```
static const int DEFAULT_RHENFAST_DEPTH = 5;
```

This value can be overridden by passing the following argument to the Rhenium Core daemon:

```
-rhenfastdepth=<n>
```

The key thing to understand is that this value indicates the number of "confirmations" a successful Transaction Lock represents. When Wallet RPC commands are performed (such as `listsinceblock`) this attribute is taken into account when returning information about the transaction. The value in `confirmations` field you see through RPC is showing the number of `"Blockchain Confirmations" + "SwiftX Depth"` (assuming the funds were sent via SwiftX).

There is also a field named `bcconfirmations`. The value in this field represents the total number of `"Blockchain Confirmations"` for a given transaction without taking into account whether it was SwiftX or not.

**Examples**
* SwiftX transaction just occurred:
    * confirmations: 5
    * bcconfirmations: 0
* SwiftX transaction received one confirmation from blockchain:
    * confirmations: 6
    * bcconfirmations: 1
* non-SwiftX transaction just occurred:
    * confirmations: 0
    * bcconfirmations: 0
* non-SwiftX transaction received one confirmation from blockchain:
